UNRARALL - hacking document

== RAR format ==

This document describes the RAR file fomart as understood by unrarall. We only worry about RAR 2.x and newer.

RAR archives are specified by the 'Rar!' signature (since 1.5) as can be seen by running "head -1 file.rar | cut -c 1-4". Unrarall does not yet check for valid rar archives but could do in the near future.

RAR archives before 3.x used the naming format .[r-z][0-9][0-9]. This was probably done for DOS, however RAR 3.x moved to using the more sensible part[0-9][0-9][0-9].rar format. It is unclear wether 3 digits is the maximum or wether it really is part[0-9]+.rar. For the sake of unrarall we assume the latter.

== Compatibility ==

This is a bash script and so is fairly unix friendly, however all testing by developers is done on Bash4+. We do however try and maintain Bash3+ compatibility mostly for OS X users who do not want to change their shell.

A reverse engineered specification of the rar format is available here:
